The factory design pattern is used when we have a superclass with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the client program to the factory class. 

# Factory Design Pattern Advantages
* Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.

* Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code.

* Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.
